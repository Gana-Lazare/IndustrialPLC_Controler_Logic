# IndustrialPLC_Controler_Logic

The Following Project is an Automatic PLC Controller Where the command of industrial Networking is Shown , nothing really advanced 
as the technologie is not up to date but the concept still the same , some Networking is used as configuration Profibus in this case  of course 
a Third party is indeed to show the real practice of this code i will recomand you to go with FestFluidSim but will Need an OPC to connect to that
